MINDTHEMOOD's BITS & BOBS is the core of Mindthemood's Marvelous Modpack; and has come to accumulate a variety of misselaneous, loosely interconnected features, namely an Archeology system,
an assosiated Artificery system, and most recently, overhauled vanilla structures with advanced (extremely messily coded) procedural generation methods. 

As a GENERAL DISCLAIMER, this project was made using MCreator generated code, and scattered bits of custom coded elements, and is generally a bit of a mess. Barring any game-breaking issues, I'm
not particularly concerned with optimization.
///////////////////////////////////////

The ARCHEOLOGY section contains stuff loosely related to archeology, including spears and daggers, new resources, natural generation for suspicious blocks, music discs and disc fragments, jack o' lantern
and carved melon variants, a couple enchantments related to the new weapons, and all the porcelain and pottery stuff. It's sort of a catch all category.

The ARTIFICERY section contains all the various artificery gadgets, as well as logic related to various projectiles and materials. The sections here are a bit more self explanatory. (Blasters, Rails, Tools, etc.) 
The Ingredients subsection contains mostly useless crafting materials; whereas the Misselaneous subsection contains gadgets and redstone components that don't fit in the other categories.

The BLOCKS section contains nonfunctional new materials, such as prismarine variants, gold and iron materials, and mossy variants of things. It also contains a bunch of deprecated versions of new materials from 1.21;
which were premptively added in 1.20, and still included for legacy support.

The CREATURES section is just mob data for the various new enemies. (Golems get their own section for some reason.)

The END section contains a bunch of deprecated features relating to the End- these features were exclusively accessed in creative mode, and are now being developed as a separate mod, but are, (again), retained just
in case for legacy support.

The FLAVOR section contains all the functions related to the Flavor block, a much better method of doing post-generation structure tweaks, which I unfortunately did not implement until fairly late in the development
process. It's used for most of the larger structures, though smaller post-generation structures still use custom generator blocks.

The GAMERULES section, as the name implies, contains Gamerules, mostly for configuration purposes.

The GIMMICKS section contains various functional new blocks; mostly traps, as well as rubble variants, lasers, and 'spawner' blocks, such as the Grimstones, and the Heart of the Sea/Inferno.

The GOLEMS section contains the mob data and construction logic for the custom golems.

The LARGE STRUCTURES section contains the structure/jigsaw data for the large stuff; that is, the Woodland Mansion, Jungle Temple, Desert Pyramid, Ocean Monument, and (eventually) the Ruined Bastion and Nether Fortress.

The MINESHAFTS section is all about mineshafts. They have their own special little generation system, so they get their own special little section.

MYSTICISM is just more deprecated features that have been moved to the end mod. Tamper with at your own risk.

PROJECTILES appropriately deals with projectiles for all the spears and charges and things. These were all auto generated following an MCreator update, and I've since been too lazy to reorganize them.

SMALL STRUCTURES contains the logic and custom generator blocks for Igloos, shipwrecks, witch huts, ocean and trail ruins, dungeons, ruined portals, and pillager outposts.

The STRUCTURE FREQUENCIES section contains gamerules specifically used to configure the occurence of small structures.

The STRUCTURE LOOT section contains all the loot tables for custom structures. (And a couple unrelated ones.)

TOTEMS & TRINKETS contains, as the name implies, all the custom totems and trinkets, along with the logic for their various abilities.

VILLAGES contains the structure data and custom generator blocks for the four village variants.

WANDS contains various custom made creative building tools specially designed by a dev too lazy to download worldEdit.

And WORLDGEN contains various world features that aren't even loosely related to the rest of the game's systems; namely lichen, brambles, wall mushrooms, and sinking sand.
