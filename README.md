MINDTHEMOOD's BITS & BOBS is the core of Mindthemood's Marvelous Modpack; and has come to accumulate a variety of misselaneous, loosely interconnected features, namely an Archeology system,
an assosiated Artificery system, and most recently, overhauled vanilla structures with advanced (extremely messily coded) procedural generation methods. 

As a GENERAL DISCLAIMER, this project was made using MCreator generated code alongside custom coded elements, and is generally a bit of a mess. Barring any game-breaking issues, I'm
not particularly concerned with optimization.
